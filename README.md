## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Where applicable add screenshots, photos, and links.

1. You will also deploy an `index.html` page to GitHub pages.

## Instructions

You will be planning a new application to develop that will be a competitor for another popular application. Your goal is to determine the minimal functionality required so you can launch your app as soon as possible.

Choose from any popular app. It can be an app for anything:

- Music
- TV/Videos
- Shopping
- Social media
- Blog
- Forum (like Stack Overflow or Reddit)
- Chat app
- Recipes
- Business reviews

## Questions

## Project Managing Tool

#### In 1-3 sentences describe your application.
A social media that connects people with the similar hobbies and future activities so no one will ever go on a trip alone specially when everyone is not available to be there when you need them to.
#### What is the name of your application?
getTogether

#### Create a minimum of 10 user stories. Make sure to use the format:

- `As a <type of user>, I want to <some goal>, so that <some reason>.`

Write the user stories below. Add more `>` for each user story or use `-` to make a list
- As a influencer, i want to not just experience things, blog or travel alone. Sometimes i need someone who share the same passion as I have to give a non-bias reviews on what or where or who Im sharing my thoughts to my viewers or followers.>
-As a traveler I love to connect with people everywhere I go, thats why I started my travels to see new place and have new connections from places I visited. >
- As a single gay men, I do a lot of things alone, It will be great to meet someone who can is able to share my ideas and making things happen.
-As a NewYorker, I tend to brush through everything, barely no time for friends. But when I have time to do what I love, its very rare that most of my friends have time to do what I want to do theres always conflict of interest. I want to have someone with me enjoying the things I want and when i am available to enjoy them.
-As a frequent traveler, I need to know information about the locals and who can I come for help and also to know the perfect time and date to visit.
-As a busy single female, I want the freedom to do things when i want and hopefully who I want. Being female and alone traveling could be dangerous and having someone with yuo kinda give you a sense of security.

### Wireframes

Create three wireframes. You may use a free online tool or draw them on paper (you can either scan them or use your phone to photograph them). You will upload them to this repository.

1. Create a wireframe for the main page that shows an index view (on mobile).

> ![Index on mobile view]()

1. Create a wireframe for a wide desktop view for either the index view.

> ![Index on desktop view]()

1. Create a wireframe for the view that has a new form (new user, new shipping information, new post, new song, new product etc.) view (on mobile).

> ![New view]()

## Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.
