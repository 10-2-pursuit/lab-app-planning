1. Where applicable add screenshots, photos, and links.

1. You will also deploy an `index.html` page to GitHub pages.

## Instructions

### Wireframes

Create three wireframes. You may use a free online tool or draw them on paper (you can either scan them or use your phone to photograph them). You will upload them to this repository.

1. Create a wireframe for the main page that shows an index view (on mobile).

> ![Index on mobile view]()

1. Create a wireframe for a wide desktop view for either the index view.

> ![Index on desktop view](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFntBWGQs8/gg1unUXPJEUH38xESMLpuA/view?utm_content=DAFntBWGQs8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink)

1. Create a wireframe for the view that has a new form (new user, new shipping information, new post, new song, new product etc.) view (on mobile).

> ![New view](https://cyclingapp.my.canva.site/)

## Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.
